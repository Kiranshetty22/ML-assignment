1. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them inreverse order with a space between them

program:
firstname = input("Input your First Name : ")
lastname = input("Input your Last Name : ")
print ("Hello  " + lastname + " " + firstname)

2. Write a Python program to calculate number of days between two dates.

program:
from datetime import date
 f_date = date(2014, 7, 6)
 l_date = date(2014, 7, 11)
 d = l_date - f_date
 print(d.days)

3.Write a Python program to test whether a passed letter is a vowel or not

program:
l = input("Input a letter of the alphabet: ")

if l in ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'):
	print("%s is a vowel." % l)
elif l == 'y':
	print("Sometimes letter y stand for vowel, sometimes stand for consonant.")
else:
	print("%s is a consonant." % l) 


4.Write a Python program to sum of three given integers. However, if two values are equal sum will be zero.


program:
def sum(x, y, z):
    if x == y or y == z or x==z:
        sum = 0
    else:
        sum = x + y + z
    return sum

print(sum(2, 1, 2))
print(sum(3, 2, 2))
print(sum(2, 2, 2))
print(sum(1, 2, 3))

5.Write a Python program to count the number of characters (character frequency) in a string.

program:

def char_frequency(str1):
    dict = {}
    for n in str1:
        keys = dict.keys()
        if n in keys:
            dict[n] += 1
        else:
            dict[n] = 1
    return dict
print(char_frequency('kiran.shetty'))
